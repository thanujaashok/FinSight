# FinSight

Accurately classifying the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of financial news articles is essential for informed investment decisions. Traditional methods might be inadequate for complex financial text. 
This creates the need for applications to track the sentiment of a company or stock over time to aid better decision making. 

## Features
- Leverages BERT: The app utilizes a pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model, known for its effectiveness in understanding complex language.
- Analyzes Financial Text: The model is specifically fine-tuned on financial news data, allowing it to capture the nuances of financial language and sentiment.
- Automates Real Time Sentiment Classification: By feeding breaking news articles into the model, you can automatically receive sentiment classifications, saving time and effort compared to manual analysis.
- Streamlined Tracking: Simplifies the process of tracking stocks, ensuring users are always aware of current market conditions and opportunities.
- Supports Investment Decisions: Understanding the overall sentiment of financial news and summary of stock data over the past month can provide valuable insights for investors, aiding in making data-driven investment choices.
